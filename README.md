##### The Time Machine - An interactive C++ "translation" of _The Time Machine_

Copyright Â© 2014 Eyal Kalderon

This is a creative response to the short science fiction novella _The Time Machine_ by H.G. Wells (1898, Heinemann text), intended as a cumulative high school project for English 12 HN, in which I attempt to represent a piece of the plot in computer code.

Please note that these source files are not pseudocode. Unlike most creative English pieces, this program (or should I say, novella) actually works. The source code provided is standards-compliant C++11 and has been tested on Arch/x64 with GCC. Stepping through the code in a debugger, analyzing the program's behavior in memory, and checking the stdout in a terminal (spoken dialogue) will let you follow the plot as it unfolds.

But of course, the greatest technical achievement lies not in the actual construction of this program, but rather in its source code. If you know some C++ or you're a curious reader or a computer science student, you will enjoy flipping through the code; it's as much fun seeing the unconventional C++ interpretations of the plot as it is watching it unfold from a birds-eye view in RAM.

If you enjoyed reading _The Time Machine_ or any of H.G. Wells spectacular novels as much as I did, you will undoubtedly enjoy reading through the source and stepping through this program as it runs.
