tmachine - An interactive C++ "translation" of _The Time Machine_ (the Holt version)
Copyright (c) 2014 Eyal Kalderon

This is a creative response to the short science fiction novella _The Time Machine_ by
H.G. Wells (1895), suggested as a cumulative high school project for English 12 Honors.

Please note that this program isn't just a static piece of nonsense pseudocode;
unlike most creative English pieces, this program (or should I say, novel) actually
works. The source code provided is standards-compliant C++11. Stepping through the code
in a debugger, analyzing the program's behavior in memory, and checking the stdout in a
terminal will let you follow the plot as it unfolds.

But of course, the greatest technical achievement lies not in the actual construction
of this program, but rather in its source code. If you are a C++ fan, or just a curious
reader or computer science student, you will enjoy flipping through the code; it's as
much fun seeing the unconventional C++ interpretations of the plot as it is watching it
unfold from a birds-eye view in RAM.

If you enjoy _The Time Machine_, or any of H.G. Wells spectacular novels, you will
undoubtedly enjoy reading through the source and stepping through this program as it
runs.
